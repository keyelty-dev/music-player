# Music Streaming Web Application

A simple music streaming web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to browse trending songs and popular artists, play audio tracks, and interact with a basic media player interface.

## Features
- Display a list of trending songs with images, titles, and playable audio.
- Showcase popular artists with their images and names.
- Interactive music player with play/pause, next/previous track controls, and a progress bar.
- Volume control with mute/unmute functionality.
- Horizontal scrolling for song and artist sections with navigation arrows.
- Responsive design with a sidebar and header for navigation.

## Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- Local server environment (recommended, e.g., Live Server in VS Code) for proper file loading.

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure the project structure includes the following folders:
   - `img/` (for image files).
   - `musics/` (for audio files).
   - `src/` (for CSS files like `output.css`).
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser or use a local server to run the application.

## Usage
- Browse the "Trending songs" and "Popular artists" sections.
- Click on a song to play it; use the player controls at the bottom to manage playback.
- Use the left and right arrows to scroll through the song and artist lists.
- Adjust the volume or mute the audio using the slider on the player.

## File Structure
